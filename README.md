# Youtube Comments Web Scrapper and Summerizer

This repo uses Playwright, Haystack, and Amazon Bedrock to summerize comments on a given youtube video.

## The Web Scrapper
The youtube_comments_scraper.py file lauches a [**Playwright**](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro) controlled browser to scrape the comments on a youtube page and save it into a local csv file.

### To run
```
python youtube_comments_scraper.py "<youtube video link>" 
```

## LMM Summerizer
haystack.ipynb can then take in the csv file, create a prompt using the values, then pass prompt through a amazon.titan-text-lite-v1 model hosted on AWS Bedrock.

This script uses [**Haystack-ai**](https://haystack.deepset.ai) to set up the csv data processing pipeline and prints out the results off LLM at the end. 

1) change var is code block 3 with the csv file path generated by the scraper.
2) Make sure that have your awssdk credentionals set up on your system. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html
3) Make sure you have access to `amazon.titan-text-lite-v1` on your aws account through [**Amazon Bedrock**](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock).
4) Run through all code blocks
